//! SVG Geometric Shapes Reference: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/shapes.html

//! This module defines SVG geometric shape structs based on the SVG 2 specification.
//! Each shape has its own file with its struct definition.
//!
//! Shapes are pure data structs constructed directly from computed geometry
